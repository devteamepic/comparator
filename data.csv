In the first part we consider duality in topological quantumfield theories, concentrating on the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten theories as(dual) approaches to the study of four-manifolds. Lower-dimensional variants ofthese theories are also discussed. In the second part of the thesis we discussduality in 2D sigma models by studying the interplay between renormalizationgroup flows - as generated by the beta functions - and T-duality. Thehypothesis put forward in the thesis is that for these to be mutuallyconsistent, they should commute as operators in parameter space. The last partof the thesis bring these subjects into perspective by reviewing somenonperturbative dualities in string theory.;Kasper Olsen;hep-th;140 pages, PhD thesis March 1999;http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9908199v1.pdf;./files/AspectsOfDuality.pdf

The first half of thisthesis will thus be dedicated to the transition from Riemannian tosemi-Riemannian manifolds. This entails a study of Clifford algebras forindefinite vector spaces and Spin structures on semi-Riemannian manifolds. Animportant consequence of this is the introduction of Krein spaces, which willenable us to generalize spectral triples to indefinite spectral triples. In thesecond half of this thesis, we will apply the formalism of noncommutativedifferential forms to indefinite spectral triples to construct noncommutativegauge theories on Lorentzian spacetimes. We will then demonstrate how torecover the Standard Model.;Nadir Bizi;math-ph;180 pages, PhD thesis;http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00038v1.pdf;./files/ThesisSemiRiemannianNoncommutativeGeometry,GaugeTheory,AndTheStandardModelOfParticlePhysics.pdf

The techniques of mathematicalphysics are plethora and have been developed for some time. The Markov model ofphylogenetics and its analysis is a relatively new technique where mostprogress to date has been achieved by using discrete mathematics. This thesistakes a group theoretical approach to the problem by beginning with aremarkable mathematical parallel to the process of scattering in particlephysics. This is shown to equate to branching events in the evolutionaryhistory of molecular units. The major technical result of this thesis is thederivation of existence proofs and computational techniques for calculatingpolynomial group invariant functions on a multi-linear space where the groupaction is that relevant to a Markovian time evolution. The practical results ofthis thesis are an extended analysis of the use of invariant functions indistance based methods and the presentation of a new reconstruction techniquefor quartet trees which is consistent with the most general Markov model ofsequence evolution.;J G Sumner;q-bio.QM;PhD thesis;http://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.3210v1.pdf;./files/Entanglement,Invariants,AndPhylogenetics.pdf

The motivation for this part of mythesis evolved from the main topic, the wave equation on singular space-times.The second and main part of my thesis is devoted to establishing a localexistence and uniqueness theorem for the wave equation on singular space-times.The singular Lorentz metric subject to our discussion is modeled within thespecial algebra on manifolds in the sense of Colombeau. Inspired by an approachto generalized hyperbolicity of conical-space times due to Vickers and Wilson,we succeed in establishing certain energy estimates, which by a furtherelaborated equivalence of energy integrals and Sobolev norms allow us to proveexistence and uniqueness of local generalized solutions of the wave equationwith respect to a wide class of generalized metrics.

The research presented here is based primarily on dispersion theoryand chiral effective-field theory. The main motivation is the recent protonradius puzzle, which is the discrepancy between the classic proton chargeradius determinations (based on electron-proton scattering and normal hydrogenspectroscopy) and the highly precise extraction based on first muonic-hydrogenexperiments by the CREMA Collaboration. The precision of muonic-hydrogenexperiments is presently limited by the knowledge of proton structure effectsbeyond the charge radius. A major part of this thesis is devoted to calculatingthese effects using everything we know about the nucleon electromagneticstructure from both theory and experiment.  The thesis consists of eight chapters. The first and last are, respectively,the introduction and conclusion. The remainder of this thesis can roughly bedivided into the following three topics: finite-size effects in hydrogen-likeatoms, real and virtual Compton scattering, and two-photon-exchange effects.;Franziska Hagelstein;nucl-th;"PhD thesis,

For the purposes of quantum computing it is usual toapproximate the artificial atoms as 2-level qubits, and much effort has beenexpended on attempts to isolate these qubits from the environment and to inventever more sophisticated control and measurement schemes.

First of all, the duality between Vafa-Witten theory and WZWmodels is embedded into string theory. Secondly, this model is generalized to aweb of dualities connecting topological string theory and N=2 supersymmetricgauge theories to a configuration of D-branes that intersect over a Riemannsurface. This description yields a new perspective on topological string theoryin terms of a KP integrable system based on a quantum curve. Thirdly, thisthesis describes a geometric analysis of wall-crossing in N=4 string theory.And lastly, it offers a novel approach to construct metastable vacua in typeIIB string theory.;Lotte Hollands;hep-th;PhD thesis, July 2009, 308 pages, 65 figures;http://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.3413v1.pdf;./files/TopologicalStringsAndQuantumCurves.pdf

Three physical systems are studied in depth, each built upon a simplemeasurement-based process. For each physical system - light from independentsources leaking onto a beam splitter monitored by photodetectors, spatiallyinterfering Bose-Einstein condensates extracted from separate preparationprocedures, and delocalised massive particles or mirrors scattering light whichis detected in the far-field - the thesis investigates the key features of theunderlying process of localisation, and explores the properties of the inducedpost-measurement states of the system. A range of analytical and numericalmethods are used. Many new results are presented - for example, cases of mixedinitial states are considered in addition to the more commonly considered purestates. Up to now there has been little attempt to develop in detail the themescommon to studies concerned with specific physical examples. This thesisaddresses this, and sets out a ""modus operandi"" that can be applied widely. Avariety of specific applications are considered - both in the context ofcontrolled laboratory experiments, and with a view to understanding processesoccurring in nature.

A particular class of non-commutative geometries calledalmost-commutative geometries can be used to describe particle theories. Thisthesis contains a systematic search for such almost-commutative geometrieswhose corresponding spectral action exhibits supersymmetry. Chapter 2 discussesextensions of the Standard Model in the context of noncommutative geometry ingeneral. In Chapter three a framework is developed to build and analyzepotential supersymmetric theories. Chapter 4 covers supersymmetry breakingmechanisms in this context.

It is designed to beresistant to small shift errors contained in momentum and position quadratures.Thus there's some intrinsic fault tolerance of the GKP code. In this thesis,wepropose a method to utilize all the information contained in the continuousshifts, not just simply map a GKP-encoded qubit to a normal qubit. This methodenables us to do maximum-likelihood decisions and thus increase fault-toleranceof the GKP code. This thesis shows that the continuous nature of the GKP codeis quite useful for quantum error correction.;Yang Wang;quant-ph;50 pages, Master Thesis, RWTH-Aachen, Germany;http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.00147v1.pdf;./files/QuantumErrorCorrectionWithTheGkpCodeAndConcatenationWithStabilizerCodes.pdf

For instance solvingthe information loss paradox will likely require a deep understanding of howthe long-sought quantum gravity theory works. In this thesis we explore howblack holes are modelled and how the quantum structure emerges in the contextof string theory. We will mainly limit to four dimensional supersymmetricsolutions, considering black holes microstates from three different viewpoints:intersecting string and branes in string theory, supergravity solutions andground states of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics living on the worldvolumeof the branes.
