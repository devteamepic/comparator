In The Second Part Of The Thesis We Discussduality In 2d Sigma Models By Studying The Interplay Between Renormalizationgroup Flows   As Generated By The Beta Functions   And T Duality. Thehypothesis Put Forward In The Thesis Is That For These To Be Mutuallyconsistent, They Should Commute As Operators In Parameter Space.

The Precision Of Muonic Hydrogenexperiments Is Presently Limited By The Knowledge Of Proton Structure Effectsbeyond The Charge Radius.
