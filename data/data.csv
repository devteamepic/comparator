To collect massive sensitive data fromusers, we propose a reward-based collaboration mechanism, where the masterannounces a total reward to be shared among collaborators, and thecollaboration is successful if there are enough users wanting to collaborate.We show that if the master knows the users' collaboration costs, then he canchoose to involve only users with the lowest costs. However, without knowingusers' private information, then he needs to offer a larger total reward toattract enough collaborators. Users will benefit from knowing their costsbefore the data acquisition. Perhaps surprisingly, the master may benefit asthe variance of users' cost distribution increases.  To utilize smartphones' computation resources to solve complex computingproblems, we study how the master can design an optimal contract by specifyingdifferent task-reward combinations for different user types. Under completeinformation, we show that the master involves a user type as long as themaster's preference characteristic outweighs that type's unit cost. Allcollaborators achieve a zero payoff in this case. If the master does not knowusers' private cost information, however, he will conservatively target at asmaller group of users with small costs, and has to give most benefits to thecollaborators.","Lingjie Duan, Takeshi Kubo, Kohei Sugiyama, Jianwei Huang, Teruyuki Hasegawa, Jean Walrand, ",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.6455v1.pdf,./files/MotivatingSmartphoneCollaborationInDataAcquisitionAndDistributedComputing.pdf

Finding asuitable master equation to describe their dynamics is therefore a crucial taskthat must be addressed with utmost attention. In the recent past, many effortshave been made toward the possibility of employing local master equations,which compute the interaction with the environment neglecting the directcoupling between the qubits, and for this reason may be easier to solve. Here,we provide a detailed derivation of the Markovian master equation for twocoupled qubits interacting with common and separate baths, considering puredephasing as well as dissipation. Then, we explore the differences between thelocal and global master equation, showing that they intrinsically depend on theway we apply the secular approximation. Our results prove that the globalapproach with partial secular approximation always provides the most accuratechoice for the master equation when Born-Markov approximations hold, even forsmall inter-system coupling constants. Using different master equations wecompute the stationary heat current between two separate baths, theentanglement dynamics generated by a common bath, and the emergence ofspontaneous synchronization, showing the importance of the accurate choice ofapproach.","Marco Cattaneo, Gian Luca Giorgi, Sabrina Maniscalco, Roberta Zambrini, ",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08893v3.pdf,./files/LocalVsGlobalMasterEquationWithCommonAndSeparateBathsSuperiorityOfTheGlobalApproachInPartialSecularApproximation.pdf

In many areasof quantum physics, including quantum technology, one must include dissipationand decoherence induced by the environment. While Markovian master equationsprovide the only really efficient way to model these effects, these masterequations are derived for constant Hamiltonians (or those with a discrete setof well-defined frequencies). In 2006, Alicky, Lidar, and Zanardi [Phys. Rev. A73, 052311 (2006)] provided detailed qualitative arguments that Markovianmaster equations could not describe systems under broadband control. Despiteapparently broad acceptance of these arguments, such master equations areroutinely used to model precisely these systems. This odd state of affairs islikely due to a lack of quantitative results. Here we perform exact simulationsof two- and three-level systems coupled to an oscillator bath to obtainquantitative results. Although we confirm that in general Markovian masterequations cannot predict the effects of damping under broadband control, wefind that there is a widely applicable regime in which they can. Masterequations are accurate for weak damping if both the Rabi frequencies andbandwidth of the control are significantly smaller than the system's transitionfrequencies. They also remain accurate if the bandwidth of control is as largeas the frequency of the driven transition so long as this bandwidth does notoverlap other transitions. Master equations are thus able to provide accuratedescriptions of many quantum information processing protocols for atomicsystems.","Gavin McCauley, Benjamin Cruikshank, Siddhartha Santra, Kurt Jacobs, ",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11160v1.pdf,./files/AbilityOfMarkovianMasterEquationsToModelQuantumComputersAndOtherSystemsUnderBroadbandControl.pdf

Our strong-couplingmaster equations are very different from other so-called ""strong-coupling""master equations (e.g. the quantum Smoluchowski equation) which are perturbingoff a limit in which the system energy is taken to be perturbative and thus thedynamics is principally Markovian. Such approximations also require the systemmass to be asymptotically large (even as compared to the ratio of noise andinduced system frequencies) and thus they do not fully categorize the regime ofwhat one might consider to be strong coupling. Our master equations are highlynon-Markovian and radically different for different system potentials,admitting no apparent generic form.

Instead we usea time coarse-graining approach which leaves us with a free timescaleparameter, which we can optimize. Comparing this approach to the standardRWA-based Markovian master equation, we find that significantly betteragreement is possible using the coarse-graining approach, for a three-levelmodel coupled to a bath of oscillators, whose exact dynamics we can solve forat zero temperature. The model has the important feature that the RWA has anon-trivial effect on the dynamics of the populations. We show that the twodifferent master equations can exhibit strong qualitative differences for thepopulation of the energy eigenstates even for such a simple model.

Weillustrated our general formulation by an explicit construction of athree-qubit system coupled to a non-Markovian bosonic environment.

Method: We appliedGrounded Theory and conducted qualitative interviews with 53 practitioners of29 software and non-software project teams from Robert Bosch GmbH. Results: Wediscovered that Scrum Masters initially plays nine leadership roles which theytransfer to the team while it matures. Roles can be transferred by providing aleadership gap, which allows team members to take on a leadership role, and byproviding an internal team environment with communication on equal terms,psychological safety, transparency, shared understanding, shared purpose andself-efficacy.

The terms of such series are often called modes. A master- (ordetermining) mode set is a subset of these modes, the time history of whichuniquely determines the time history of the entire turbulent flow provided thatthis flow is developed. In the present work the existence of themaster-mode-set is demonstrated numerically for turbulent channel flow. Theminimal size of a master-mode set and the rate of the process of the recoveryof the entire flow from the master-mode set history are estimated. The velocityfield corresponding to the minimal master-mode set is found to be a goodapproximation for mean velocity in the entire flow field. Mean characteristicsinvolving velocity derivatives deviate in a very close vicinity to the wall,while master-mode two-point correlations exhibit unrealistic oscillations. Thiscan be improved by using a larger than minimal master-mode set. The near-wallstreaks are found to be contained in the velocity field corresponding to theminimal master-mode set, and the same is true at least for the large-scale partof the longitudinal vorticity structure. A database containing the time historyof a master-mode set is demonstrated to be an efficient tool for investigatingrare events in turbulent flows.

Using this master equation we show that, apart from brief transients,the resonator always behaves like a damped harmonic oscillator with a shiftedfrequency and relaxes into a thermal-like steady state. Although the behaviourremains qualitatively the same, we find that the magnitude of the resonatordamping rate and frequency shift depend very sensitively on the relativemagnitudes of the resonator period and the electron tunnelling time. Maximumdamping occurs when the electrical and mechanical time-scales are the same, butthe frequency shift is greatest when the resonator moves much more slowly thanthe island charge. We then derive reduced master equations which describe justthe resonator dynamics. By making slightly different approximations, we obtaintwo different reduced master equations for the resonator. Apart from minordifferences, the two reduced master equations give rise to a consistent pictureof the resonator dynamics which matches that obtained from the master equationincluding the SET island charge.","Denzil Rodrigues, Andrew Armour, ",http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0510236v1.pdf,./files/QuantumMasterEquationDescriptionsOfANanomechanicalResonatorCoupledToASingleElectronTransistor.pdf

The electron spin state selective (singlet and triplet) recombinationprocesses are described with a Haberkorn reaction term in this master equation.Here we consider a general spin state selective electron transfer reaction of aradical pair and use Nakajima-Zwanzig theory to derive the master equation forthe spin density operator, thereby elucidating the relationship betweennon-adiabatic reaction rate theory and the Haberkorn reaction term. A secondorder perturbation theory treatment of the diabatic coupling naturally resultsin the Haberkorn master equation with an additional reactive scalar electronspin coupling term. This term has been neglected in previous spin chemistrycalculations, but we show that it will often be quite significant. We also showthat beyond second order in perturbation theory, i.e., beyond the Fermi goldenrule limit, an additional reactive singlet-triplet dephasing term appears inthe master equation. A closed form expression for the reactive scalar electronspin coupling in terms of the Marcus theory parameters that determine thesinglet and triplet recombination rates is presented. By performing simulationsof radical pair reactions with the exact Hierarchical Equations of Motion(HEOM) method, we demonstrate that our master equations provide a very accuratedescription of radical pairs undergoing spin-selective non-adiabatic electrontransfer reactions.

At array stations, cross correlationdemonstrates a higher resolution because the time delays at individual sensorsfrom master and slave events are the same but they may differ from theoreticalones used in standard beamforming. In the regions where master events and thuswaveform templates are available, one can reduce the amplitude threshold ofsignal detection by a factor of 2 to 3 relative to standard beamforming andSTA/LTA detector used at the International Data Centre.

In the continuum limit, masterequations lead to Fokker-Planck partial differential equations that representthe dynamics of physical systems in continuous spaces. Over the last fewdecades, nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations have become very popular incondensed matter physics and in statistical physics. Numerical solutions ofthese equations require the use of discretization schemes. However, thediscrete evolution equation obtained by the discretization of a Fokker-Planckpartial differential equation depends on the specific discretization scheme. Ingeneral, the discretized form is different from the master equation that hasgenerated the respective Fokker-Planck equation in the continuum limit.Therefore, the knowledge of the master equation associated with a givenFokker-Planck equation is extremely important for the correct numericalintegration of the latter, since it provides a unique, physically motivateddiscretization scheme. This paper shows that the Kinetic Interaction Principle(KIP) that governs the particle kinetics of many body systems, introduced in[G. Kaniadakis, Physica A, 296, 405 (2001)], univocally defines a very simplemaster equation that in the continuum limit yields the nonlinear Fokker-Planckequation in its most general form.","Giorgio Kaniadakis, Dionissios T.

An exact steady-state solution to the master equation iscalculated. One of the main goals in this paper is to investigate whether theprobability distribution of gene copies contains even-odd number oscillations.A master equation previously derived in the adiabatic limit of fast switchingby Kepler and Elston \cite{kepler} suggests that the oscillations should bepresent. However our analysis demonstrates that the oscillations do not happennot only in the adiabatic case but they are entirely absent. We discuss theadiabatic approximation in detail. The other goal is to establish the masterequation that takes into account external fluctuations that is similar to themaster equation in the adiabatic approximation. The equation allows even-oddoscillations. The reason the behaviour occurs is an underlying interference ofPoisson and Gaussian processes. The master equation contains an extra term thatdescribes the gene copy number unconventional diffusion and is responsible forthe oscillations.

In this paper, we examine the entropy production both for themaster equation and for the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. For themaster equation, the exact expression of the entropy production was recentlyderived by Gaspard using the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy ({\em J.Stat.Phys.},\textbf{117} (2004), 599; [Errata; \textbf{126} (2006), 1109 ]). AlthoughGaspard's expression is derived from a stochastic consideration, it should benoted that Gaspard's expression conincides with the thermodynamical expression.For the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, by using the detailed imbalancerelation which appears in the derivation process of the fluctuation theoremthrough the Onsger-Machlup theory, the entropy production is expressed in termsof the {\em irreversible circulation of fluctuation}, which was proposed byTomita and Tomita ({\em Prog.Theor.Phys.}, \textbf{51} (1974), 1731). However,this expression for the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation differs from thatof the entropy production for the master equation. This discrepancy is due tothe difference between the master equation and the corresponding Fokker-Planckequation, namely the former treats discrete events, but the latter equation isan approximation of the former one. In fact, in the latter equation, theoriginal discrete events are smoothed out. To overcome this difficulty, wepropose the {\em path weight principle}. By using this principle, the modifiedexpression of the entropy production for the corresponding Fokker-Planckequation coincides with that of the master equation (i.e., the thermodynamicalexpression) for a simple chemical reaction system and a diffusion system.","Hiroyuki Tomita, Mitsusada M.

It is this zero-energylocalized bound state that protects Majorana zero modes from decoherence, as along-time non-Markovain memory effect.

We use two qubits coupled to aLorentzian environment in a spin-boson like fashion modeling a genericsituation with various system and bath time scales. We see that, independent ofthe initial state, the simple Redfield Equation with time dependentcoefficients is significantly more accurate than all other methods underconsideration. We emphasize that positivity violation in the Redfield formalismbecomes relevant only in a regime where any of the perturbative masterequations considered here are rendered invalid anyway. This implies that theloss of positivity should in fact be welcomed as an important feature: itindicates the breakdown of the weak coupling assumption.

For weakly-damped systems the Lindblad-form Markovianmaster equation is invaluable for this task due to its tractability andefficiency. This equation only applies, however, when the frequencies of anysubset of the system's transitions are either equal (degenerate), or theirdifferences are much greater than the transitions' linewidths (far-detuned).Outside of these two regimes the only available efficient description has beenthe Bloch-Redfield master equation. This equation has long been the subject ofdebate because it does not guarantee to preserve the positivity of the densitymatrix. The ability to efficiently simulate weakly-damped systems across allregimes is becoming increasingly important, especially in the area of quantumtechnologies. Here we derive a completely positive, Lindblad-form masterequation valid for all regimes, and demonstrate its accuracy by comparing it toexact simulations of a variety of systems coupled to an Ohmic bath. The newmaster equation describes all weakly-damped systems for which, like the Ohmicbath, the spectral density does not vary sharply on the scale of thetransitions' Lamb shifts and linewidths. We also show via exact simulations oftwo examples, that the trivial adiabatic extension of this master equation canaccurately describe systems with time-dependent transition frequencies thatcross each other during the evolution, so long as the time dependence is nottoo fast.

In order to characterize the mathematical features and the physicalorigin of the dynamics, it is often useful to consider different kinds ofmaster equations for the same system. Here, we derive an exact connectionbetween the time-local and the integro-differential descriptions, focusing onthe class of commutative dynamics. The use of the damping-basis formalismallows us to devise a general procedure to go from one master equation to theother and vice-versa, by working with functions of time and their Laplacetransforms only. We further analyze the Lindbladian form of the time-local andthe integro-differential master equations, where we account for the appearanceof different sets of Lindbladian operators. In addition, we investigate aRedfield-like approximation, that transforms the exact integro-differentialequation into a time-local one by means of a coarse graining in time. Besidesrelating the structure of the resulting master equation to those associatedwith the exact dynamics, we study the effects of the approximation onMarkovianity. In particular, we show that, against expectation, the coarsegraining in time can possibly introduce memory effects, leading to a violationof a divisibility property of the dynamics.","Nina Megier, Andrea Smirne, Bassano Vacchini, ",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11948v1.pdf,./files/TheInterplayBetweenLocalAndNonLocalMasterEquationsExactAndApproximatedDynamics.pdf

The procedure of stochastization of one-step process was formulated.It allows to write down the master equation based on the type of of the kineticequations and assumptions about the nature of the process. The kinetics of theinteraction has recently attracted attention because it often occurs in thephysical, chemical, technical, biological, environmental, economic, andsociological systems. However, there are no general methods for the directstudy of this equation. Leaving in the expansion terms up to the second orderwe can get the Fokker-Planck equation, and thus the Langevin equation. Itshould be clearly understood that these equations are approximate recording ofthe master equation. However, this does not eliminate the need for the study ofthe master equation. Moreover, the power series produced during the masterequation decomposition may be divergent (for example, in spatial models). Thismakes it impossible to apply the classical perturbation theory. It is proposedto use quantum field perturbation theory for the statistical systems (theso-called Doi method). This work is a methodological material that describesthe principles of master equation solution based on quantum field perturbationtheory methods. The characteristic property of the work is that it isintelligible for non-specialists in quantum field theory. As an example theVerhulst model is used because of its simplicity and clarity (the first orderequation is independent of the spatial variables, however, containsnon-linearity).

Theprotein degrades in its free and bound forms. This network breaks detailedbalance and involves a single bimolecular reaction step. We provide an exactsolution of the steady-state master equation for arbitrary values of theparameters, and present simplified solutions for a number of special cases. Thefull parametric dependence of the analytical non-equilibrium steady-stateprobability distribution is verified by direct numerical solution of the masterequations.

Lyapunov-Krasovskii stabilityanalysis shows that the proposed strategy (i) can confine the position errorbetween the master and slave to an invariant set, and (ii) can drive itexponentially to a globally attractive set. Thus, the dynamic interconnectionand damping injection approach has practical relevance for telemanipulationtasks with given precision requirements.","Yuan Yang, Daniela Constantinescu, Yang Shi, ",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.05500v1.pdf,./files/DynamicInterconnectionAndDampingInjectionForInputToStateStableBilateralTeleoperation.pdf

The linear Fokker-Planck equations arewell-known, but here they are derived as a limit N->infty of a simple lineardiffusion equation on (3N-C)-dimensional N-velocity spheres of radius sqrt(N)(with C=1 or 4 depending on whether the system conserves energy only or energyand momentum). In this case, a spectral gap separating the zero eigenvalue fromthe positive spectrum of the Laplacian remains as N->infty,so that theexponential approach to equilibrium of the master evolution is passed on to thelimiting Fokker-Planck evolution in R^3. The non-linear Fokker-Planck equationis known as Landau's equation in the plasma physics literature. Its N-particlemaster equation, originally introduced (in the 1950s) by Balescu and Prigogine(BP), is studied here on the (3N-4)-dimensional N-velocity sphere. It is shownthat the BP master equation represents a superposition of diffusion processeson certain two-dimensional sub-manifolds of R^{3N} determined by theconservation laws for two-particle collisions. The initial value problem forthe BP master equation is proved to be well-posed and its solutions are shownto decay exponentially fast to equilibrium. However, the first non-zeroeigenvalue of the BP operator is shown to vanish in the limit N->infty. Thisindicates that the exponentially fast approach to equilibrium may not be passedfrom the finite-N master equation on to Landau's nonlinear kinetic equation.","Michael K. -H.

The connection between these two descriptions is a classic topic inmathematical physics. One direction was solved by the now famous result due toLindblad, Kossakowski Gorini and Sudarshan, who gave a completecharacterisation of the master equations that generate completely positivesemi-groups. However, the other direction has remained open: given a CPT map,is there a Lindblad master equation that generates it (and if so, can we findit's form)? This is sometimes known as the Markovianity problem. Physically, itis asking how one can deduce underlying physical processes from experimentalobservations.  We give a complexity theoretic answer to this problem: it is NP-hard. We alsogive an explicit algorithm that reduces the problem to integer semi-definiteprogramming, a well-known NP problem. Together, these results imply thatresolving the question of which CPT maps can be generated by master equationsis tantamount to solving P=NP: any efficiently computable criterion forMarkovianity would imply P=NP; whereas a proof that P=NP would imply that ouralgorithm already gives an efficiently computable criterion. Thus, unless Pdoes equal NP, there cannot exist any simple criterion for determining when aCPT map has a master equation description.  However, we also show that if the system dimension is fixed (relevant forcurrent quantum process tomography experiments), then our algorithm scalesefficiently in the required precision, allowing an underlying Lindblad masterequation to be determined efficiently from even a single snapshot in this case.

Time-independentor memoryless master equations, in particular, can be cast in the well-knownLindblad form. Any time-local master equation, Markovian or non-Markovian, mayin fact also be written in a Lindblad-like form. A diagonalisation procedureresults in a unique, and in this sense canonical, representation of theequation, which may be used to fully characterize the non-Markovianity of thetime evolution. Recently, several different measures of non-Markovianity havebeen presented which reflect, to varying degrees, the appearance of negativedecoherence rates in the Lindblad-like form of the master equation. Wetherefore propose using the negative decoherence rates themselves, as theyappear in the canonical form of the master equation, to completely characterizenon-Markovianity. The advantages of this are especially apparent when more thanone decoherence channel is present. We show that a measure proposed by Rivas etal. is a surprisingly simple function of the canonical decoherence rates, andgive an example of a master equation that is non-Markovian for all times t>0,but to which nearly all proposed measures are blind. We also give necessary andsufficient conditions for trace distance and volume measures to witnessnon-Markovianity, in terms of the Bloch damping matrix.","Michael J. W. Hall, James D.

TheMaster wants to distribute these computations to untrusted workers who havevolunteered or are incentivized to help with this task. However, the data mustbe kept private and not revealed to the individual workers. Some of the workersmay be stragglers, e.g., slow or busy, and will take a random time to finishthe task assigned to them. We are interested in reducing the delays experiencedby the Master. We focus on linear computations as an essential operation inmany iterative algorithms such as principal component analysis, support vectormachines and other gradient-descent based algorithms. A classical solution isto use a linear secret sharing scheme, such as Shamir's scheme, to divide thedata into secret shares on which the workers can perform linear computations.However, classical codes can provide straggler mitigation assuming a worst-casescenario of a fixed number of stragglers. We propose a solution based on newsecure codes, called Staircase codes, introduced previously by two of theauthors. Staircase codes allow flexibility in the number of stragglers up to agiven maximum, and universally achieve the information theoretic limit on thedownload cost by the Master, leading to latency reduction. Under the shiftedexponential model, we find upper and lower bounds on the Master's mean waitingtime. We derive the distribution of the Master's waiting time, and its mean,for systems with up to two stragglers. For systems with any number ofstragglers, we derive an expression that can give the exact distribution, andthe mean, of the waiting time of the Master.

We use the system-size expansion to show thatchemical Fokker-Planck estimates of the mean concentrations and of the varianceof the concentration fluctuations about the mean are accurate to order$\Omega^{-3/2}$ for reaction systems which do not obey detailed balance and atleast accurate to order $\Omega^{-2}$ for systems obeying detailed balance,where $\Omega$ is the characteristic size of the system. Hence the chemicalFokker-Planck equation turns out to be more accurate than the linear-noiseapproximation of the chemical master equation (the linear Fokker-Planckequation) which leads to mean concentration estimates accurate to order$\Omega^{-1/2}$ and variance estimates accurate to order $\Omega^{-3/2}$. Thishigher accuracy is particularly conspicuous for chemical systems realized insmall volumes such as biochemical reactions inside cells. A formula is alsoobtained for the approximate size of the relative errors in the concentrationand variance predictions of the chemical Fokker-Planck equation, where therelative error is defined as the difference between the predictions of thechemical Fokker-Planck equation and the master equation divided by theprediction of the master equation.

The usual functionalGamma does not behave as a scalar under the transformation law inherited fromits very definition as the Legendre transform of W = ln Z, although it doesbehave as a scalar under an unusual transformation law. The master functional,on the other hand, is the Legendre transform of an improved functional W withrespect to the sources coupled to both elementary and composite fields. Theinclusion of certain improvement terms in W and Z is necessary to make the newLegendre transform well defined. The master functional behaves as a scalarunder the transformation law inherited from its very definition. Moreover, itadmits a proper formulation, obtained extending the set of integrated fields toso-called proper fields, which allows us to work without passing through Z, Wor Gamma. In the proper formulation the classical action coincides with theclassical limit of the master functional, and correlation functions andrenormalization are calculated applying the usual diagrammatic rules to theproper fields.

Usually, in mean fieldtheory, one can bypass the large Nash equilibrium, by introducing the conceptof representative agent, whose action is influenced by a distribution ofsimilar agents, and obtains directly the system of HJB-FP equations ofinterest, see for instance [1]. Apparently, there is no such approach for theMaster equation. We show here that it is possible.

The key idea behind the modelwas to partition reactions into fast and slow groups, and then to combineMarkov chain updating scheme for the slow set with diffusion (Langevin)approach updating scheme for the fast set. Then, the state vector of the modelwas defined as the summation of the random time change model and the solutionof the Langevin equation.
